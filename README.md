## 1. **Introduction**

### **What is it?**
MasterMindIQ is a general quiz designed to test the general knowledge of young adults from around the age of 16 and upwards. 
- The quiz application has a difficulty section of three levels and five general categories for the players to chose from to their liking.
- Each game consists of 10 questions with a player feedback at the end of each game which are score number specific. 

The **Project Aim** was to design a game that most age groups of online user can play if they wish so. *MasterMindIQ* was also designed to be as *interactive *with its players as possible and allowing them to *fully control* the type of game they each wish to play.
 A quiz game was chosen for this reason and five categories were included with three difficulty levels to match the interest and knowledge level of each player. The category topics are general rather than being specific to give players the opportunity and like the quiz game. If one can't answer any question because they're too related, they may lose interest and never return in the future. 

 ### **How it works?**
 1. The landing page welcomes the user and automatically starts interacting with them by asking them to enter their player name and either click the button or press 'Enter'. 
 2. This is followed by the menu page with a personalised message at the top with details taken from the form of the landing page. Underneath, each player can chose a difficulty level (easy level is automatically checked) followed by five general categories to include the interest of most players. 
 3. Once the player has clicked on their chosen category, a rule page pops up to explain the rules of the game before the actual game begins. The game includes a player score board showing the score, question number and number of incorrect answers. This is followed by the question and four possible answers with only one correct answer.
 4. Once the game is finished, i.e 10 questions have been answered, each player jumps to the end user feedback page where a warm welcome message awaits followed by their score number and based on that, a specific end comment. 

 ### **Who is it for**
The target audience is global and any user from the age of 16 has good potential to get a couple of questions correct. Another reason the creator build a quiz game was to include all age groups of the global target audience. 

**New User** : Each new user has the ability to play up to 15 games with different questions if they so wish. Each of the 5 categories consist of 3 levels of 10 questions. A young adult with secondary school knowledge should have the knowledge to test themselves on easy levels while medium and hard levels are designed for older generations. The landing page asks each player to enter a player name to personalise the game. 

**Returning User** : The chances of playing all 15 games during their first visit is low which means that as a returning user, other categories can be played at several difficulty levels. One of the first updates of this potential quiz game would be to implement APIs and expand the question database of each category to enhance the number of returning users.

### **Planning**

The planning process started by designing one html page (**index.html**) with each page represented by a section. CSS and Javascript was then used to hide and display depending on what the user is clicking on.

The creator has also made a rough sketch of functions he is going to use within his *script.js* to make the quiz game work.

**Planning Colours**
The creator used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) website to chose six colors including a neutral body color, red for incorrect, green for incorrect and the rest for other parts and buttons. The colors he chose are as follows and used **hsl** in this project to test it out.

In terms of screen sizes, the creator used *flex-display* through each section to ensure that the game looks identical on every screen-size. As a result, the sketches for each section above also represent smaller and bigger screens using flex and different font and buttons sizes.
